Building the Program

This contains a Gradle build script. So if the compressed file containing this project is imported as a gradle project, all the
dependancies for this project will be automatically downloaded by gradle.

The Program is structured into a number of packages including,
activitystreamer, activitystreamer.client, activitystreamer.server and activitystreamer.util. A breakdown on what each package
contains is described below.

activitystreamer:	Code containing the main entry points to the program. If you want to run a server or a client,
					these files can be compiled and executed.
					
activitystreamer.client:	Contains the code for the client


activitystreamer.server:	Contains code for the server

activitystreamer.util:	Contains common code, used by both client and server

A log4j2.xml file is also required. This configures the logging mechanism, which is based on log4j.
